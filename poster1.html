            Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire (transl. Commander) is a 2023 Indian Telugu-language epic action film written and directed by Prashanth Neel and produced by Vijay Kiragandur. It stars Prabhas and Prithviraj Sukumaran, with a supporting cast that includes Shruti Haasan, Jagapathi Babu, Bobby Simha, Tinnu Anand, Easwari Rao, Sriya Reddy and Ramachandra Raju. Set in the fictional dystopian city-state of Khansaar, the film follows the friendship between Deva (Prabhas), a tribesman, and Varadha (Prithviraj), the prince of Khansaar. When a coup d'état is planned by his father's ministers and his relatives, Varadha enlists Deva's help to become Khansaar's undisputed ruler.

            The film's initial story was pitched from Neel's debut film Ugramm (2014)[4] and is the maiden part of a two-part film. It was officially announced in December 2020 under the title Salaar, however, in July 2023, the official title was announced as Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire. Principal photography commenced in January 2021, and occurred sporadically in several legs over nearly three years, before wrapping in late 2023. Filming locations included Telangana, Italy and Budapest. Production difficulties, ranging from the pandemic, reshoots and VFX delays, postponed Salaar's release date several times. The music is composed by Ravi Basrur, cinematography handled by Bhuvan Gowda and editing by Ujwal Kulkarni.
            
            Salaar was theatrically released on 22 December 2023 in standard and IMAX formats to a generally mixed-to-positive reception from critics. It was a hit at the box office, earning over ₹715 crore on a ₹270 crore budget, making it the highest-grossing Telugu film of 2023, 3rd highest-grossing Telugu film of all time and 11th highest-grossing Indian film of all time.
